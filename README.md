# bread_quest
File-based text adventure game. Made out of everyone's favorite italian pasta (spaghetti) and C++.

In order to play you MUST extract one of the .tar.gz files into a directory named "game"

The structure should look like this:

```
  bread_quest/
    |
    \> a.out
    \> game/
         |
         \> title
         \> items
         \> 0,0
```
      
On Linux to extract and set up one of the demo game packages you can:

  tar xvf <name>.tar.gz
  mv <name> game/

Remember to feel free to make something on this engine, the demo packages are all of the content EVER made for this engine, and
50% of it was just to test out some new stuff. Make sure you read through the source code. I am bad at commenting, but it should
give you some helpful insight if you are creating a campaign.
  
I'd love to see all of the things you make with this engine, send them to me!
