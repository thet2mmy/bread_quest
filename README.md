# bread_quest
File-based text adventure game. Made out of everyone's favorite italian pasta (spaghetti) and C++.

In order to play you MUST extract one of the .tar.gz files into a directory named "game"

The structure should look like this:

  bread_quest/
    |
    \> ./a.out
    \> game/
         |
         \> title
         \> items
         \> 0,0
         
On Linux to extract and set up one of the demo game packages you can:

  tar xvf <name>.tar.gz
  mv <name> game/
